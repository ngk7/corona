Although those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, many develop flu-like symptoms, including <strong>fever, cough, and shortness of breath</strong>. Emergency symptoms include <strong>difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips</strong>; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms, such as <strong>sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat </strong>may be seen. Symptoms such as <strong>nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</strong> have been observed in varying percentages among people in several studies, with percentages varying from 3% to 31% of cases depending on the study. Some initial cases in China presented only chest tightness and palpitations. In some, the disease may progress to <strong>pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death</strong>.

As it is common with infections, there is a delay from when a person is infected with the virus to when they develop symptoms, known as the incubation period. The incubation period for <strong>COVID-19</strong>is typically five to six days but may range from <strong>two to 14 days</strong>.97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.</div>

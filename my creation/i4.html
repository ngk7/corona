		The disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome <strong>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</strong>, previously referred to as the <strong>2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</strong>. A study investigating the rate of decay of the virus found no viable viruses after<strong> 4 h on copper, 24 h on cardboard, 72 h on stainless steel, and 72 h on plastic</strong>. However, detection rates did not reach 100% and varied between surface type (limit of detection was 3.33Ã—100.5 TCID50 per liter of air for aerosols, 100.5 TCID50 per milliliter of medium for plastic, steel, and cardboard, and 101.5 TCID50 per milliliter of medium for copper). Estimation of the rate of decay with a Bayesian regression model suggests that viruses may remain viable up to <strong>18 h on copper, 55 h on cardboard, 90 h on stainless steel, and over 100 h on plastic</strong>. The virus remained viable in aerosols throughout the time of the experiment (3 h).
